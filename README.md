# Bus Service System

This is a simple bus service system implemented in Java. It allows users to add new buses, update bus timings, remove buses, book tickets, and cancel tickets. The system maintains information about buses, tickets, and their statuses in separate text files.

## Project Structure

- `Buses.txt`: Contains the data about buses in the system.
- `Tickets.txt`: Contains the data about tickets booked by users.
- `FileHelper.java`: Provides file I/O operations for reading and writing to text files.
- `demo.java`: A demo program to interact with the system by booking or canceling tickets.
- `Consumer.java`: Represents a consumer that can book or cancel tickets.

## Instructions

To run the bus service system:

1. Compile all Java files in the project.
2. Run the `demo.java` file.
3. Follow the prompts to perform operations like booking tickets or canceling tickets.
